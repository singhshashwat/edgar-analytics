Dependency: Require packages to import os, sys, csv, datatime , timedelta and from collections import OrderedDic



Code is progrrammed in Python 3.4
Run.sh can be used to run the program.
[python ./src/sessionization.py ./input/log.csv ./input/inactivity_period.txt ./output/sessionization.txt]


I have created 3 more test cases with more data and some errored data set.
The program has passed all of them.
