Code is progrrammed in Python 3.4

Dependency: Require packages to import os, sys, csv, datatime , timedelta and from collections import OrderedDic

Run.sh can be used to run the program.
Or can use cmd with this syntax [python ./src/sessionization.py ./input/log.csv ./input/inactivity_period.txt ./output/sessionization.txt]


I have created 3 more test cases with more data and some errored data set.
The program has passed all of them.
